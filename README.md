# Requirements Tracker

Over the years, I came up with an effective way to organize the software development process
by means of capturing and tracking functionality with a high degree of granularity.  Simply put,
if a developer needs to make a decision or write a function, it has to be documented as a "feature".

The goal of this project is to create a desktop tool that supports the process.
